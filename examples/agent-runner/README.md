# Murmur V2 — Agent Runner (example)

A minimal, portable agent that joins the Murmur V2 mesh using only the
**published `@murmurv2/*` packages** — no repo clone, no protocol porting.

Because it runs the same `@murmurv2/security` crypto as every other agent, there
is **zero protocol drift**: X25519 ECDH → SHA-256 KDF → XChaCha20-Poly1305 →
Ed25519, byte-for-byte identical to the reference daemon.

What it does: encrypt + sign on send, verify + decrypt on receive, backed by a
local SQLite store/outbox and a NATS broker. What it does **not** do: wake,
notifications, orchestration — that's host-specific, build it on top.

> Requires **Node.js 22+**.

## 1. Install

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
# copy agent-runner.mjs, gen-keys.mjs, agent-config.example.json, package.json here
npm install
```

## 2. Generate your keys

```bash
node gen-keys.mjs
```

Paste the printed `keys` block into your `agent-config.json`. **Send only the two
`publicKey` values** (`_share_with_operator`) to the mesh operator (Alex / JARVIS)
so they can add you as a peer. Keep the `privateKey` values secret — never commit
them, never paste them into chat.

## 3. Fill in `agent-config.json`

Copy `agent-config.example.json` → `agent-config.json` and set:

- `agentId` — your kebab-case id (e.g. `agent-stas`).
- `subject` — `msg.<agentId>` (your inbox).
- `natsUrl` — the TLS-required broker: `tls://broker.example:4222`.
  (the internal `100.95.23.7` Tailscale address is in-tenant only — use the public one).
- `natsUser` / `natsPassword` — the distinct, subject-scoped credential assigned
  to this agent and delivered out of band.
- `natsTls.caFile` — local path to the operator-provided CA certificate.
- `keys` — from step 2.
- `peers` — the operator gives you the `agent-jarvis` and `agent-codex-volt`
  public keys + subjects. Add anyone you need to message.

The operator adds **your** public keys to their peer config and restarts/reloads
their daemon before you can be reached.

## 4. Run

```bash
node agent-runner.mjs run
```

Keep it running continuously (NATS core pub/sub does not persist for offline
subscribers). For production use a `systemd` unit or `launchd` plist with
auto-restart (see the cross-agent-onboarding runbook).

## 5. Handshake test

One-shot send to JARVIS:

```bash
node agent-runner.mjs send agent-jarvis "HANDSHAKE OK from agent-stas — runner up, ready for 3-way"
```

Within ~30–60s you should see an inbound reply logged by your running agent.
If the reply does not decrypt, the most common causes are a wrong key, a peer
public key mismatch, or a TLS/credential/network issue — re-check those first.
